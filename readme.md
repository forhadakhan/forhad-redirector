# 🔍 Forhad Finder

A cool, animated landing page that simulates a terminal-style console with a cyberpunk matrix background. It displays the message:

> **"Finding the Forhad you are looking for..."**

...then automatically redirects to [forhadakhan.com](https://forhadakhan.com) after a short delay.
